Hello Max,

First of all thankyou so much for tsfresh. i  am trying to change the fdr_level and i am having a problem:
FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings can somehow not be imported and therefore I am not being able to change the fdr. 
I am using Windows 10, Tsfresh 0.12.0. already here the problem is presented: 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import preprocessing
import math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy 
from tsfresh import extract_features
from tsfresh import select_features
from tsfresh import extract_relevant_features

%matplotlib inline
from tsfresh import defaults
from tsfresh.utilities.dataframe_functions import check_for_nans_in_columns
from tsfresh.feature_selection.relevance import calculate_relevance_table
from tsfresh.examples.robot_execution_failures import download_robot_execution_failures, load_robot_execution_failures
from tsfresh import extract_features, extract_relevant_features, select_features, feature_selection  
from tsfresh.utilities.dataframe_functions import impute
from tsfresh.feature_extraction import ComprehensiveFCParameters

# neither if i write from tsfresh.feature_selection.settings import FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings
from tsfresh.feature_selection import FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings
sett = FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings()
sett.fdr_level = 0.99 # increases the risk of unimportant features being extracted
sett.write_selection_report = True # will create a report with more information

ImportError: cannot import name 'FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings'


I tried with tsfresh.feature_selection.settings import FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings and didnt work.
I also tried downgrading tsfresh to older versions and still no results. 

I would thankyou so much if you could find the reason for my problem 

I wish you a nice day :)
Erik
